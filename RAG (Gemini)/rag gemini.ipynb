Transformer can increase or decrease the voltage with \\ncorresponding decrease or increase in current.  \\nWorking principle of transformer  \\n \\n The basic  principle  behind  working  of a transformer  is the phenomenon of mutual induction between two \\nwindings linked by common magnetic flux. The figure at right shows the simplest form of a transformer. \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive coils; primary winding and secondary winding. The coils are \\nelectrically separated but magnetically linked to ea ch other. When, primary winding is connected to a source of \\nalternating voltage, alternating  magnetic  flux is produced  around  the winding . The core provides magnetic  path \\nfor the flux, to get linked with the secondary winding. Most of the flux gets linked with the secondary winding \\nwhich is called as 'useful flux' or main 'flux', and the flux which does not get linked with secondary winding is \\ncalled as 'leakage flux' .  As the flux produced is alternating (the direction of it is continuously changing), EMF \\ngets induced in the secondary winding according to  Faraday's  law of electrom agnetic  induction . This emf is \\ncalled 'mutually induced emf', and the frequency of mutually induced emf is same as that of supplied emf. If the \\nsecondary winding is closed circuit, then mutually induced current flows through it, and hence the electrical \\nenergy is transferred from one circuit (primary) to another circuit (secondary).  \\n \\nBasic construction of transformer  \\nBasically a transformer consists of two inductive windings and a laminated steel core. The coils are insulated \\nfrom each other as well as from  the steel core. A transformer may also consist of a container for winding and \\ncore assembly (called as tank), suitable bushings to take our the terminals, oil conservator to provide oil in the \\ntransformer tank for cooling purposes etc. The figure at left illustrates the basic construction of a transformer.  \\n In all types of transformers, core is constructed by assembling (stacking) laminated sheets of steel, with \\nminimum air -gap between them (to achieve continuous magnetic path). The steel used is having hi gh silicon \\ncontent and sometimes heat treated, to provide high permeability and low hysteresis loss. Laminated sheets of \\nsteel are used to reduce eddy current loss. The sheets are cut in the shape as E,I and L. To avoid high reluctance \\n\"),\n",

Thus, total transformer loss depends on volt -ampere (VA). It does not \\ndepend on the p hase angle between voltage and current, i.e. transformer loss is independent of load \\npower factor. This is the  reason  that transformers  are rated  in kVA . \\nLosses in transformer  \\n \\nIn any  electrical  machine , 'loss' can be defined as the difference between input power and output power. \\nAn electrical  transformer  is an static  device , hence mechanical losses (like windage or friction losses) are absent \\nin it.

Hence these losses are also known as  core losses  or iron losses . \\n▪ Hysteresis  loss in transformer : Hysteresis loss is due to reversal of magnetization in the transformer core. \\nThis loss depends upon the volume and grade of the iron, frequency of magnetic reversals and value of flux \\ndensity. It can be given by, Steinmetz formula:  \\nWh= ηB max1.6fV (watts)  \\nwhere,   η = Steinmetz hysteresis constant  \\n             V = volume of the core in m3 \\n▪ Eddy  current  loss in transformer : In transformer, AC current is supplied to the primary winding which \\nsets up alternating magnetizing flux. When this flux links with secondary winding, it produces induced emf \\nin it. But some part of this flux also gets linked with other conducting parts like steel core or iron body or \\nthe transformer, which will result in induced emf in those parts, causing small circulating current in them. \\nThis current is called as eddy current. Due to these eddy currents, some energy will be dissipated in the form \\nof heat. \\n (ii) Copper loss in transformer  \\nCopper loss is due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.   Copper loss for the primary winding is \\nI12R1 and for secondary winding is I 22R2. Where, I 1 and I 2 are current in primary and secondary winding \\n\"),\n",
